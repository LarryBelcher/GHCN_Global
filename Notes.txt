Processing notes for GHCN Global Temperature Anomaly code

1) For the 620px image, the template calls for the data region to be 620x316. Due to 
aspect ratio constraints in python, the actual size is 620x314. Even so, I am able to
retain the total image size of 620x365.

2) For the 1000px image, the template calls for the data region to be 1000x508. Due to 
aspect ratio constraints in python, the actual size is 1000x504. For this one, the total
image size is 1000x555 (spec sheet called for 1000x558)

3) For the DIY colorbar and text elements, I was unable to add both the color bar png and
the logo png into the eps output. Instead, I set it up to do the cbar and text as an eps
and the zip the image, the eps, and an eps version of the logo into the zip file.

4) For the DIY logo, I created an eps using ImageMagic. This was to enable development of
the DIY script, specifically the zipping functionality. This file should be replaced with
an official NOAA logo of the desired size in vector format (e.g., encapsulated postscript).

5) On HD, date and title font location are specified to be at the same height.
