README for GHCN Global Temperature Anomaly image re-projection

Abstract:
Six python scripts are contained in this project that re-project GHCN
Global Temperature Anomaly data onto a Hammer-Aitoff map. The source 
images have been downloaded from:
http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/Portal_Ohio/e3.html

Program listing:
ghcn_monthly_620.py - Re-projects GHCN monthly images output to a 
			620px wide image
ghcn_monthly_1000.py - Re-projects GHCN monthly images output to a 
			1000px wide image
ghcn_monthly_1920.py - Re-projects GHCN monthly images output to a 
			1920pxX1080px image
ghcn_yearly_620.py - Re-projects GHCN yearly images output to a 
			620px wide image
ghcn_yearly_1000.py - Re-projects GHCN yearly images output to a 
			1000px wide image
ghcn_yearly_1920.py - Re-projects GHCN yearly images output to a 
			1920pxX1080px image
image_meta.py - A script to create metadata for the image stack

Program Usage:
Any of these scripts can be used to create an output image of the
desired size. A script can be called from prompt and the call must
include the path to the original image, e.g.:
ghcn_monthly_620.py /Images/Monthly/ANOM.monthly.201308.color.png

The filename passed into the script must be of the format:
ANOM.monthly.201308.color.png
The scripts simply parses this filename in order to derive the date
(e.g., 201308) in order to correctly name the output image. The
parsing is conducted on the "." in the filename, so any preceeding
element in the path to the file must not contain a ".". This could
easily be modified in any of the scripts to account for other naming
and/or filesystem path name conventions.

Software and Dependencies:
The scripts included here were built for Python 2.7. The following
modules must exist on the system for them to perform correctly:
matplotlib-1.4
mpl_toolkits.basemap
Image
ImageOps
numpy
urllib
shapefile
sys
os
subprocess
time
matplotlib.font_manager

Other files in this project:
original_image_metadata.txt - Shows the URL source and creation 
		date/time of the original images used for re-projection
reprojected_image_metadata.txt - Shows the creation date/time of
		the re-projected images for this project
***Note - The original and re-projected images do not exist
		within the source directory for this project, but can be
		provided as "zip" archives
colorbar and logo ".png" files included are sized for each of the
re-projection image sizes and called/used by the various python
scripts


UPDATE (11/29/2013):

Modified the monthly and yearly scripts:
1) Changes data range on colorbar to agree with the new data ranges (-6F to 6F) shown
on the new images at http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/view/
2) Fixed "halo" image on colorbar border

Added a script to update the "original" images from http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/view/ ftp site
